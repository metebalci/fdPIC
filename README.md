# picDIV_XC8

This is a migration of a part of picDIV (http://www.leapsecond.com/pic/picdiv.htm) project, specifically pd07 (http://www.leapsecond.com/pic/src/pd07.asm) that is the 10MHz to 1Hz/1pps clock downconverter.

The copyright of the original idea and the implementation belongs to the author of picDIV (Tom Van Baak (tvb)  www.LeapSecond.com/pic). 

The original project is written for Microchip MPASM assembler (MPASM). This project has the same functionality (of pd07) but compiles in MPLAB XC8 PIC Assembler (PIC Assembler).

Additionally the project is targeted for PIC12F629 rather than PIC12F675.
